# Highlights App 

<h3> The Architecture </h3>
<ul>
  <li> The App is a simple React JS app </li>
  <li> I have also used Material UI and React pan pinch zoom for styling and feature of the web app. </li>
</ul>
The app consists of 4 componenets namely, Sidebar componenet which contains the "Add bucket" and "Add Highlight" to add a new bucket name or to add a new highlight respectively. The second componenet is the Note Container which is holding another componenet called Notes. <br>
We can add new bucket name which will be saved in the local cache of the browser and can be used by notes to group them. We can select the bucket name from the dropdown menu and the note will be linked to that bucket name. <br>

<h3> Steps to Set Up locally </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Open the github repo link. </li>
  <li> Click on the green "Code" button drop down and copy the SSH to copy the repo link for cloning. </li>
  <li> Open terminal in your computer and make sure that your computer has node and git installed in it by typing, "node -version". </li>
  <li> If their are no errors, you are good to go, type git clone "link-you-copied".</li>
  <li> Once the process is done, change the directory of terminal to newly created folder. </li>
  <li> Now in the terminal, type "npm i" to install all the required node_modules.</li>
  <li> Once the node modules are installed, type, "npm run start", this will open the app in local port 3000.</li>
</ul>
